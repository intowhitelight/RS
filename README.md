# Navigating the Labsheets
The Labsheets provide some icons to help you navigate quickly.  

<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/theory.png" align="left"> This is a section that provides background theory for what we are about to work on.  You can complete the exercises without the theory, but you will be able to make smarter choices if you gain a deeper understanding first.
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/stop.png" align="left"> This is a section that contains important information you must respect to avoid damaging the robot, or to stay within the requirements for your Assessments.
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/tick.png" align="left"> This is a section that provides advice on best practice, or confirms what we have achieved so far.
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/info.png" align="left"> This is a section that contains information on **common problems** or **common solutions**.  These are designed to help you to avoid common pitfalls (time spent inefficiently).
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/exercise.png" align="left"> This is a section that contains **exercises**: you are expected to find solutions, usually by writing code.  If you are in a hurry, you can scan the labsheets to find these yellow icons.
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/validate.png" align="left"> This is a section that guides you to validate and confirm the operation of your work.  This is an important practice in robotics.  Make sure your solutions are working as you expect them to!    
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/observation.png" align="left"> This is a section that encourages you to observe, reflect and think about broader implications for the exercises we are completing.  This is important to develop a high level of familiarity with the robotic system, from which we can make more intelligent choices.
<br><br>
<img width="40px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_53/main/Images/hypothesis.png" align="left"> This is a section that asks you to make a prediction or theory, drawing on your knowledge and experience so far.  You will also want to consider how you could then observe and measure the effects.
